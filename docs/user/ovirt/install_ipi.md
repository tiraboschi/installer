# Install using oVirt platform provider

## Overview
This provider enables the Openshift Installer to provision VM resources in an \
oVirt data center, that will be used as worker and masters of the clusters. It \
will also create the bootstrap machine, and the configuration needed to get \
the initial cluster running by supplying DNS a service and load balancing, all \
using static pods.

This work is related to the Bare-Metal provider because oVirt does not supply \
DNS and LB services but is a platform provider. See also [OpenShift-MetalÂ³ kni-installer](https://github.com/openshift-metal3/kni-installer)

## Prerequisite
1. IP for the kubernetes api, that all components will interact with
2. IP for the internal DNS service, to bootstrap etcd and to resolve names like \
   `api.$CLUSTER_NAME.$DOMAIN` and node names
3. RHCOS openstack image uploaded and ready as a template in oVirt

To work with this provider one must supply 2 IPs that are related to any MAC \
in the virtualization env, where the cluster will run. Those IPs will be active \
by keepalived, on, initially the bootstrap machine, and then the masters, after \
a failover, when the bootstrap is killed.

Locate those IP's in the target network. If you want the network details, go to \
oVirt's webadmin and look for the designated cluster details and its networks.

One way to check if an IP is in use is to check if it has ARP associated with it \ 
- perform this check while on one of the hosts that would run the VMs:
```console
$ arp 10.35.1.19
10.35.1.1 (10.35.1.1) -- no entry
``` 

The RHCOS openstack qcow2 image can be found [here][image].

For upstream users the FCOS image can be used from the built-in glance \
provider - see this ansible role  https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-ansible-image-template
Use it to make a template from the glance image.

## Install
Start the interactive installation and supply the relevant details:
```console
$ openshift-install create cluster

```

When the all prompts are done the intstaller will create 3 VMs under the oVirt \
cluster supplied, and another VM as the bootstrap node
The bootstrap will perform ignition fully and will advertise the IP in the \
prelogin msg. Go to oVirt webadmin UI, and open the console of the bootstrap
VM to get it.

In the end the installer finishes and the cluster should be up.
To access the cluster as the system:admin user:
 
```console
$ export KUBECONFIG=/home/user/auth/kubeconfig
$ oc get nodes
```
